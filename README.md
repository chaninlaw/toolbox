# Go Toolbox

This Go Toolbox provides a set of utilities to streamline the development process. One of the primary features is the `initialize` command, which helps you quickly set up a new Go project with a boilerplate structure.

## Features

- **Initialize Project**: Create a new Go project with a predefined structure and boilerplate code.

## Installation

To use the toolbox, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can install the toolbox by running:

```
go install github.com/chaninlaw/toolbox
```

## Usage

After installing, you can use the toolbox commands from your terminal. To initialize a new Go project, run:

```
go run github.com/chaninlaw/toolbox cmd/toolbox
```

This command will prompt you for the project name and create the necessary files and directories for your new Go project.
